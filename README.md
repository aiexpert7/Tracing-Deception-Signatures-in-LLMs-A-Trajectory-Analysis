# Tracing-Deception-Signatures-in-LLMs-A-Trajectory-Analysis

# Steps to Reproduce

1. Get a bakground on the basics of LLMs, Layers, and Transformers.
2. Run the code in .ipynb files in order, you may have to get pro GPU access of colab, moslty it will work on free tier.
3. For the reproducing the results of the paper, you will need to run the code on a A100 GPUs with 80 GB memory.
